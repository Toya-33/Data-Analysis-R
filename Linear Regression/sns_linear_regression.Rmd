# Introduction

Do higher film budgets lead to more box office revenue? Let's find out if there's a relationship using the movie budgets and financial performance data that were scraped from [the-numbers.com](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets) on **May 1st, 2018**.

# Import Statements
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)  
library(lubridate)  
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(viridis)
```

# Read the Data
```{r}
df <- read_csv("cost_revenue_dirty.csv")
head(df)
```
# Cleaning the Data
Checking for NA values and duplicates.
```{r}
is.null(df)
```
```{r}
sum(duplicated(df))
```
```{r}
glimpse(df)
```
**Insight**: We noticed that there's no NA values or duplicates which is good, however we can see that aside from the column "Rank" seem to be incorrect. We need to change the "Release_Date" to datetime and "USD_Production_Budget", "USD_Worldwide_Gross", "USD_Domestic_Gross" to double data-type.

## Changing the data types
```{r}
string_to_rm <- list("[$]", "[,]")

#format data
for (r in string_to_rm){
  df$USD_Production_Budget <- str_replace_all(df$USD_Production_Budget,r,"")
  df$USD_Worldwide_Gross <- str_replace_all(df$USD_Worldwide_Gross, r, "")
  df$USD_Domestic_Gross <- str_replace_all(df$USD_Domestic_Gross, r, "")
}

#change data type
df$Release_Date <- as.Date(df$Release_Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
df$USD_Production_Budget <- as.numeric(df$USD_Production_Budget)
df$USD_Worldwide_Gross <- as.numeric(df$USD_Worldwide_Gross)
df$USD_Domestic_Gross <- as.numeric(df$USD_Domestic_Gross)

#check data
head(df)
```
Now that the dataframe is cleaned, let's proceed to the analysis phrase:

# Analysis 
## Descriptive Statistics

1. What is the average production budget of the films in the data set?
2. What is the average worldwide gross revenue of films?
3. What is the average domestic gross revenue of films?

```{r}
sprintf("Average Production Budget: $%#.2f.",mean(df$USD_Production_Budget))
sprintf("Average Worldwide Gross: $%#.2f.",mean(df$USD_Worldwide_Gross))
sprintf("Average Domestic Gross: $%#.2f.",mean(df$USD_Domestic_Gross))
```
### Production Budget
```{r}
summary(df$USD_Production_Budget)
```
### Worldwide gross
```{r}
summary(df$USD_Worldwide_Gross)
```
### Domestic gross
```{r}
summary(df$USD_Domestic_Gross)
```
**Insight:**
We observe that the average production cost for each film is approximately 31 million dollars, with a mean worldwide gross revenue of around 88 million dollars. Notably, the minimum gross revenue for both global and domestic figures is 0 dollars, indicating that some films fail to generate any revenue. Conversely, examining the highest gross revenue for global and domestic yields staggering figures of 2.78 billion dollars and 936.66 million dollars, respectively, highlighting the remarkable earning potential of certain films. Additionally, the bottom 25% of films are profitable but not substantially so, with an average budget of around 5 million dollars. Their combined revenue slightly exceeds 5 million dollars, placing them just above the break-even point.

# Investigating the Zero Revenue Films
How many films grossed $0 domestically (i.e., in the United States)? What were the highest budget films that grossed nothing?
```{r}
zero_domestic <- df %>% 
  filter(USD_Domestic_Gross == 0)
zero_domestic <- zero_domestic[order(zero_domestic$USD_Production_Budget, decreasing = TRUE),]
zero_domestic
```
How many films grossed $0 worldwide? What are the highest budget films that had no revenue internationally?
```{r}
zero_international <- df %>% filter(USD_Worldwide_Gross == 0)
zero_international <- zero_international[order(zero_international$USD_Production_Budget, decreasing = TRUE),]
zero_international
```
**Insight:** we can see that there is 512 films that have 0 gross domestic revenue and 357 films that have 0 gross global revenue.

How many films were releases exclusively for international audience?
```{r}
international_releases <- df %>% filter(USD_Domestic_Gross == 0 & USD_Worldwide_Gross != 0)
international_releases
```
**Insight:** We can see that there are a total of 155 films that were exclusively released globally but not domestic which explained why there is zero domestic gross revenue.

## Unreleased Films

Here we want to drop all of the films that are not release yet. So we are going to create a new dataframe called `cleaned_df`.
```{r}
# Date of Data Collection
scrape_date <- as.Date('2018-5-1', format="%Y-%m-%d")
not_released <- df %>% filter(Release_Date >= scrape_date)
not_released
```
**Insight**: We find that the zero gross revenue data also contains movies not yet released at the time of data collection, so our next step is to exclude these rows from our dataframe.
```{r}
cleaned_df <- df[df$Release_Date < scrape_date,]
cleaned_df
```
## Films that Lost Money

What is the percentage of films where the production costs exceeded gross revenue?
```{r}
cleaned_df <- cleaned_df %>% 
  mutate(
    Total_Revenue = USD_Worldwide_Gross + USD_Domestic_Gross
  )

losing_money <- cleaned_df %>% filter(USD_Production_Budget > Total_Revenue)
pct_losing_money <- (nrow(losing_money)/nrow(cleaned_df))*100
cat("The percentage that films were losing money is %", pct_losing_money)
```
# Data Viz: Bubble Charts
```{r}
ggplot(cleaned_df, aes(x = USD_Production_Budget, y=Total_Revenue)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Revenue And Expense") +
  xlab("Production Budget in $100 millions") +
  ylab("Revenue in $ billions")
```
<br />**Insight:** The scatter plot shows that most data points cluster in the bottom left corner. This suggests that the majority of films earn low revenues compared to their high production costs, indicating that most films either face losses or gain minimal profits.

## Plotting Movie Revenue over Time
```{r}
ggplot(cleaned_df, aes(x = Release_Date, y=Total_Revenue)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Total_Revenue)) +
  labs(title = "Movie Revenue Over Time") +
  xlab("Release Date") +
  ylab("Revenue in $ billions") +
  scale_color_viridis(option = "D")
```
**Insight**: The graph indicates an upward trend in the highest gross revenues for films over time. Additionally, it shows an increase in the number of film productions, as evidenced by the large cluster of dots in the bottom right corner.

# Converting Years to Decades Trick
Let's broaden our view by examining the trends in film over the decades.
```{r}
cleaned_df <- cleaned_df %>% mutate(Decades = as.integer(format(cleaned_df$Release_Date, "%Y")))
cleaned_df$Decades <- (cleaned_df$Decades %/% 10)*10
```
