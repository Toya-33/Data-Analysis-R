# Introduction

Do higher film budgets lead to more box office revenue? Let's find out if there's a relationship using the movie budgets and financial performance data that were scraped from [the-numbers.com](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets) on **May 1st, 2018**.

# Import Statements
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)  
library(lubridate)  
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(viridis)
```

# Read the Data
```{r}
df <- read_csv("cost_revenue_dirty.csv")
head(df)
```
# Cleaning the Data
Checking for NA values and duplicates.
```{r}
is.null(df)
```
```{r}
sum(duplicated(df))
```
```{r}
glimpse(df)
```
**Insight**: We noticed that there's no NA values or duplicates which is good, however we need to change the "Release_Date" to datetime and "USD_Production_Budget", "USD_Worldwide_Gross", "USD_Domestic_Gross" to double data-type.

## Changing the data types
```{r}
string_to_rm <- list("[$]", "[,]")

#format data
for (r in string_to_rm){
  df$USD_Production_Budget <- str_replace_all(df$USD_Production_Budget,r,"")
  df$USD_Worldwide_Gross <- str_replace_all(df$USD_Worldwide_Gross, r, "")
  df$USD_Domestic_Gross <- str_replace_all(df$USD_Domestic_Gross, r, "")
}

#change data type
df$Release_Date <- as.Date(df$Release_Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
df$USD_Production_Budget <- as.numeric(df$USD_Production_Budget)
df$USD_Worldwide_Gross <- as.numeric(df$USD_Worldwide_Gross)
df$USD_Domestic_Gross <- as.numeric(df$USD_Domestic_Gross)

#check data
head(df)
```
Now that the dataframe is cleaned, let's proceed to the analysis phrase:

# Analysis 
## Descriptive Statistics

1. What is the average production budget of the films in the data set?
2. What is the average worldwide gross revenue of films?
3. What is the average domestic gross revenue of films?

```{r}
sprintf("Average Production Budget: $%#.2f.",mean(df$USD_Production_Budget))
sprintf("Average Worldwide Gross: $%#.2f.",mean(df$USD_Worldwide_Gross))
sprintf("Average Domestic Gross: $%#.2f.",mean(df$USD_Domestic_Gross))
```
### Production Budget
```{r}
summary(df$USD_Production_Budget)
```
### Worldwide gross
```{r}
summary(df$USD_Worldwide_Gross)
```
### Domestic gross
```{r}
summary(df$USD_Domestic_Gross)
```
**Insight:**
We observe that the average production cost for each film is approximately 31 million dollars, with a mean worldwide gross revenue of around 88 million dollars. Notably, the minimum gross revenue for both global and domestic figures is 0 dollars, indicating that some films fail to generate any revenue. Conversely, examining the highest gross revenue for global and domestic yields staggering figures of 2.78 billion dollars and 936.66 million dollars, respectively, highlighting the remarkable earning potential of certain films. Additionally, the bottom 25% of films are profitable but not substantially so, with an average budget of around 5 million dollars. Their combined revenue slightly exceeds 5 million dollars, placing them just above the break-even point.

# Investigating the Zero Revenue Films
How many films grossed $0 domestically (i.e., in the United States)? What were the highest budget films that grossed nothing?
```{r}
zero_domestic <- df %>% 
  filter(USD_Domestic_Gross == 0)
zero_domestic <- zero_domestic[order(zero_domestic$USD_Production_Budget, decreasing = TRUE),]
zero_domestic
```
How many films grossed $0 worldwide? What are the highest budget films that had no revenue internationally?
```{r}
zero_international <- df %>% filter(USD_Worldwide_Gross == 0)
zero_international <- zero_international[order(zero_international$USD_Production_Budget, decreasing = TRUE),]
zero_international
```
**Insight:** we can see that there is 512 films that have 0 gross domestic revenue and 357 films that have 0 gross global revenue.

How many films were releases exclusively for international audience?
```{r}
international_releases <- df %>% filter(USD_Domestic_Gross == 0 & USD_Worldwide_Gross != 0)
international_releases
```
**Insight:** We can see that there are a total of 155 films that were exclusively released globally but not domestic which explained why there is zero domestic gross revenue.

## Unreleased Films

Here we want to drop all of the films that are not release yet. So we are going to create a new dataframe called `cleaned_df`.
```{r}
# Date of Data Collection
scrape_date <- as.Date('2018-5-1', format="%Y-%m-%d")
not_released <- df %>% filter(Release_Date >= scrape_date)
not_released
```
**Insight**: We find that the zero gross revenue data also contains movies not yet released at the time of data collection like "Singularity" and "Aquaman", so our next step is to exclude these rows from our dataframe.
```{r}
cleaned_df <- df[df$Release_Date < scrape_date,]
cleaned_df
```
## Films that Lost Money

What is the percentage of films where the production costs exceeded gross revenue?
```{r}
cleaned_df <- cleaned_df %>% 
  mutate(
    Total_Revenue = USD_Worldwide_Gross + USD_Domestic_Gross
  )

losing_money <- cleaned_df %>% filter(USD_Production_Budget > Total_Revenue)
pct_losing_money <- (nrow(losing_money)/nrow(cleaned_df))*100
cat("The percentage that films were losing money is %", pct_losing_money)
```
# Data Viz: Bubble Charts
```{r}
ggplot(cleaned_df, aes(x = USD_Production_Budget, y=Total_Revenue)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Revenue And Expense") +
  xlab("Production Budget in $100 millions") +
  ylab("Revenue in $ billions")
```
<br />**Insight:** The scatter plot shows that most data points cluster in the bottom left corner. This suggests that the majority of films earn low revenues compared to their high production costs, indicating that most films either face losses or gain minimal profits.

## Plotting Movie Revenue over Time
```{r}
ggplot(cleaned_df, aes(x = Release_Date, y=Total_Revenue)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Total_Revenue)) +
  labs(title = "Movie Revenue Over Time") +
  xlab("Release Date") +
  ylab("Revenue in $ billions") +
  scale_color_viridis(option = "D")
```

<br />**Insight**: The graph indicates an upward trend in the highest gross revenues for films over time. Additionally, it shows an increase in the number of film productions, as evidenced by the large cluster of dots in the bottom right corner.

# Converting Years to Decades Trick
Let's broaden our view by examining the trends in film over the decades.
```{r}
cleaned_df <- cleaned_df %>% mutate(Decades = as.integer(format(cleaned_df$Release_Date, "%Y")))
cleaned_df$Decades <- (cleaned_df$Decades %/% 10)*10
```
## Separate the "old" (before 1969) and "New" (1970s onwards) Films

* `old_films` should include all the films before 1969 (up to and including 1969)
* `new_films` should include all the films from 1970 onwards
```{r}
old_films <- cleaned_df %>% filter(Decades < 1970)
new_films <- cleaned_df %>% filter(Decades >= 1970)
```
### Old films 
```{r}
summary(old_films)
```
### New Films
```{r}
summary(new_films)
```
**Insight**: Based on this quick data summary, we learnt that new films are able to earn drastically more money than the old films, despite the small different in production cost. The most expensive new film had a production cost of 425 million and earned a maximum of 3.54 billion, whereas the most expensive old film was 420 million with a revenue of only around 589 million, almost seven times less than what new films make. There are a couple reasons for this: 
1. The are more people enjoying films
2. Higher films ticket price
3. Production company utilize more advance technology which reduce production cost.

# Regression Plots
**Linear Regression Formula:**
$$ REV \hat ENUE = \theta _0 + \theta _1 BUDGET$$
## New Films
```{r}
ggplot(new_films, aes(x = USD_Production_Budget, y= Total_Revenue)) + 
  geom_point(color = "darksalmon") +
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+ 
  labs(title = "Revenue VS Production Cost (New Films)") +
  xlab("Production Cost in $100 million")+
  ylab("Total Revenue in $billion")
```

```{r}
lm_revenue <- lm(data = new_films, formula = Total_Revenue ~ USD_Production_Budget)
summary(lm_revenue)
```
**Insight:** In summary, our regression model features an intercept of -2.589e+06 or -2.589 million, a coefficient of 4.247, and an R-squared value of 0.5468. 

It's important to note that when the film budget is zero, the estimated revenue is -2.589 million, which is impractical since how can we lost money without creating a film. One reason for this is that our model is very simple, we only predefined it as a straight line and find the best fit for our overall data, thus we need to be cautious on how we interpret our model. 

The coefficient of 4.247 implies that a one-dollar increase in the budget corresponds to a 4.247 dollar increase in revenue. Lastly, the R-squared value of approximately 0.5468 suggests that our model can explain about 54.68% of the variance in revenue data, showcasing a reasonably accurate prediction considering how simple our model is with only one independent and dependent variable.

## Old Films
```{r}
lm_revenue <- lm(data = old_films, formula = Total_Revenue ~ USD_Production_Budget)
summary(lm_revenue)
```
**Insight**: Regarding old movies, our model's R-squared value is only 0.04262, which is quite low. This suggests that our simple model fails to predict the relationship between a one-unit increase in production budget and the change in gross revenue. Therefore, our model is ineffective for predicting the gross revenue of old films.

```{r}
ggplot(old_films, aes(x = USD_Production_Budget, y= Total_Revenue)) + 
  geom_point(color = "darksalmon") +
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+ 
  labs(title = "Revenue VS Production Cost (Old Films)") +
  xlab("Production Cost in $100 million")+
  ylab("Total Revenue in $billion")
```
<br />**Insight**: Here is a visualization of our model for old films. There are hardly any dots on our regression line.
